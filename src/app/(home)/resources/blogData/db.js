Every month 12% of the (Basic salary+ Dearness Allowance) along with a matching contribution by the employer flows into the EPF account. For an employee drawing more than Rs 15,000 per month, it would mean that an employee can opt for a maximum deduction of Rs 1,800 (12% of Rs 15,000) instead of 12% of the (Basic salary+ Dearness Allowance). From the employer's contribution, 8.33% goes into a pension vehicle—the Employee's Pension Scheme (EPS) but it is calculated on Rs 15,000 a month and 3.67% towards the EPF. So for every employee with basic pay equal to Rs 15,000 or more, the diversion is Rs 1,250 each month into EPS. If the basic pay is less than Rs 15000 per month, then 8.33% of that full amount will go into EPS. Additionally, the employer also pays 0.5% of Basic Salary towards Employee's Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme (EDLI) or a max of Rs 75/- per employee per month, 0.01% towards EDLI handling Charges and 0.65% towards EPF Administrative Charges."

Besides, unlike PPF returns that fluctuate in line with 10-year government bonds yield, the interest rate on VPF is the same as that of the EPF.Though hiking the PF Contribution would mean lesser net take-home pay, it would be suitable for those employees who are closer to retirement and those who are in the higher-income earning bracket since it fetches a higher return than other fixed return instruments providing for more financial stability later. Young savers would be better off opting for a higher equity component through the NPS or equity funds rather than enhancing their debt allocation through VPF."

For example, the ESI scheme has wider coverage than the PF Scheme, as ESI kicks in once a business has 10 employees or more, while in PF it is 20 or more. Further, the ESI scheme is for up to a Gross Salary of Rs 21,000/-, while Rs 15,000/- in PF refers only to Basic Salary, wherein CTC driven sectors the Salary may well be up to Rs 30,000/- a month. The criteria of below 100 employees and 90% are in fact quite irrelevant as the goal is to fund the retiral cost of the lower segment of organized workers. Their plight is no different if their employer has 100 employees or 10,000 employees. The Subsidy to have been more comprehensive could have included ESI as well.The coverage of the current scheme would perhaps cover a maximum of 8 million workers and has an estimated outlay of Rs 5,000 Crores. While had the scheme been formulated for those covered under ESI, the coverage would have been for about 36 million workers.Notwithstanding the PF subsidy funding, this crisis may well force many small businesses to shut shop or resort to wage cuts, due to cash flow challenges. Had the Scheme been linked to ESI, then the Unemployment Insurance cover could have been extended to those workers being laid off during these 3 months. In any case, only recently the ESI Department had slashed contributions by 40% due to the fund surplus of Rs 84,000 Crores that they consistently had over the recent years.In our view, though the PF Subsidy Scheme has been framed with good intentions by the government, the question that remains unanswered is whether the measures announced would be sufficient enough to make a significant economic impact on the lives of the lower-income wage earners in the organized or MSME sector. We believe that a lot more needs to be done on this front."
